for ()

given some tree

() is a tree of itself and should be contained that way

     A
  B   E
 C D (G+F)

can be held as :

      A
  B    E
 C D  +
     F  G

 so create a tree and drop then ()

 easy way to do it will literally be creating a new tree and doing some tree addition

 could do a preliminary check to see if there are matching amounts of '(' and ')'
    can do this recursively
    have dictionaries    '(', ')' => count1, count2
    go through and add and subtract to these dictionaries make sure that these counts are valued at 0
